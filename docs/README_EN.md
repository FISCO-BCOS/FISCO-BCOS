FISCO BCOS is a secure and robust enterprise-level open source financial consortium blockchain platform, which was jointly created by the FISCO open source working group and officially launched in December 2017.

In a single-chain configuration, the performance can reach more than 20k TPS. FISCO BCOS provides rich features including group architecture, parallel computing, distributed storage, pluggable consensus mechanism, privacy protection algorithms, and OSCCA-approved cryptography modules. After a long period of practical testing in the production environment by industry partners, it has financial-grade high performance, high availability and high security.

FISCO BCOS 3.0 is the latest major upgrade with the following new features:

- **Microservice Architecture**: The modular design architecture of microservices supports independent and parallel expansion of computing, storage, and network.

- **Deterministic multi-contract parallel algorithm**: The intelligent parallel scheduling engine can automate contract-level parallelism and greatly increase transaction throughput.

- **Pipelined PBFT consensus mechanism**: A new upgrade and revision of PBFT to pipeline block packaging, verification, and consensus stages, which significantly improves system efficiency.

- **WeBankBlockchain Liquid and WASM virtual machine**: Besides Solidity, it also supports WeBankBlockchain Liquid contract, which makes the contract more powerful.

- **Blockchain File System**: Supports the "what you see is what you get" blockchain resource management method, which improve user experience for blockchain contract writers and data governance users.

- **Scenario-optimized service models**: Supports different service models for service deployment, including Air (lightweight) version, Pro (professional) version and Max (massive cluster) version to meet the needs of diversified scenarios.
